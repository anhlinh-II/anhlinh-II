# 🧑‍💻 Portfolio: Nguyen Anh Linh

Hi there! I'm **Nguyen Anh Linh**, a student at the **National Economics University (NEU)** in Vietnam.  
You can find me on GitHub as **[@anhlinh-II](https://github.com/anhlinh-II)**.

Despite being a self-proclaimed **lazy person** who **isn't exactly passionate about coding**, I’ve managed to build a technical foundation and contribute to projects using modern web technologies.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

My survival stack — the tech I mostly use (and tolerate):

- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot  
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS  
- **Others:** REST APIs, Git, basic SQL

> I may not love coding, but I believe in making things that *work* — clean, minimal, and (hopefully) not painful to debug.

## 🧪 Projects

While I don't actively pursue coding for fun, I have participated in a few academic and side projects:

- `📦 [Mini E-Commerce System]`: A basic full-stack system built with Spring Boot + React  
- `🎯 [Quiz Game UI]`: A front-end only quiz game using React + Tailwind  
- `🧾 [NEU GPA Calculator]`: A small personal tool to help NEU students calculate GPA  

(Feel free to check my GitHub for more... or not 😄)

## 📚 Learning Goals

- Explore non-coding roles in tech: product, QA, data, or project coordination  
- Learn just enough DevOps to survive internship interviews  
- Improve soft skills like teamwork, time management (especially the latter)  
- Find a path where I can **thrive without burning out**

## 💬 Fun Fact

> I'm the kind of developer who dreams of a job where I debug once and chill forever.
